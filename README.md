```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  Cout << "I don’t care what you think about me. I don’t think about you at all";
}
```

I'm currently studying to become an information security specialist. 
I know C++, C#, Python and Swift. In my free time, I develop bots for Discord or Telegram and I can make a website to order💻

I'm open to job offers💼

As for my interests, it's simple. I love chess and billiards. I have a yellow belt in karate🥋 and I love spending time with my friends.
